            <p class="index">License plates have been issued in the United States for over 100 years. Most people donâ€™t pay attention to them beyond expiration dates and vanity plates, but a small group of people have taken an interest in collecting them, preserving them, and learning about their history.</p>
            <p class="index">Every year, old plates are found in landfills, abandoned buildings, and old estate sales, some of which have been given values up to several thousand dollars due to their rarity.</p>
