                <td><p>Before states started issuing license plates, some would require motorists to make their own plates when registering vehicles. These plates could be made out of materials such as leather, and depending on the state, would display different letters of numbers, sometimes containing the owner's initials, other times showing a state-issued number. These plates are commonly called prestate plates.</p></td>
